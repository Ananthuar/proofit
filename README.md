# Proofit üéØ  

## Basic Details  
### Team Name: Error 404: Not Found  
### Team Members  
- **Team Lead:** Ananthu A R ‚Äì College of Engineering and Management Punnapra  
- **Member 2:** Madhav R ‚Äì College of Engineering and Management Punnapra  

### Project Description  
Proofit is a unique to-do list application designed to ensure that tasks are not only completed but also verified.  
Unlike traditional task managers, Proofit requires users to upload photographic proof before a task can be marked as completed.  
This makes it perfect for personal accountability, team management, or project tracking where evidence of work done is essential.  

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
Poor habit formation when self-managing tasks, since there is no tangible proof for confirmation.  

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
By making users submit photo evidence before marking tasks as done ‚Äî we turn procrastination into a documented art form.  
No proof, no completion!
